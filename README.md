🥗 Fresh Meal

A fully responsive multi-page e-commerce website.

It includes a multi-page layout, a dynamic shopping cart system powered by LocalStorage, and a clean, modern UI.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend e-commerce functionality without a backend, making it a solid showcase for my coding skills.
